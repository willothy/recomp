# Recomp

A "modern" compositor for X11, written in Rust and based on WGPU and Vulkan.

## Why?

There really aren't many X compositors out there, and there are very few of those that are still maintained.
Also, as far as I'm aware, none are written in Rust / using WGPU. Most are forks of the original compositor,
xcompmgr, which is written in C.

## Status

Basically a test. Not usable at all yet.
